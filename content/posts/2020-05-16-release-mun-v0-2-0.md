After half a year of hard work by the Mun Community and Core Team, we are happy to present
[Mun v0.2.0](https://github.com/mun-lang/mun/releases/tag/v0.2.0). With the addition of
[hot reloadable structs](../../01/memory-mapping), this forms a big step forward in
terms of hot reloadability for the language.

#### What's Mun?

[Mun](https://mun-lang.org) is an embeddable programming language empowering creation through
iteration. The idea to create Mun originated out of frustration with the Lua dynamic scripting
language and a desire to have similar hot reloading functionality available in Rust. As such, it's
not a direct competitor with Rust, but instead is intended to be used with Rust (or C/C++) as a
host/embedded language pairing. Actually, Mun is completely written in Rust, building on similar
crates as [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer) and
[rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust). Its key features include:

- **Ahead of time compilation** - Mun is compiled ahead of time (AOT), as opposed to being
  interpreted or compiled just in time (JIT).

- **Statically typed** - Mun resolves types at compilation time instead of at runtime, resulting in
  immediate feedback when writing code and opening the door for powerful refactoring tools.

- **First class hot-reloading** - Every aspect of Mun is designed with hot reloading in mind. Hot
  reloading is the process of changing code and resources of a live application, removing the need
  to start, stop and recompile an application whenever a function or value is changed.

#### What's new?

Mun v0.2 brings a *ton* of updates. For a full list have a look at the
[changelog](https://github.com/mun-lang/mun/releases/tag/v0.2.0), but the main new features are:

* Hot reloadable data structures
* Marshalling of data structures to Rust, C, and C++
* Garbage collection for data structures (with opt-out at the struct-level)
* `loop`, `while`, `break` and explicit` return` expressions
* Full operator support for numeric and boolean types
* Incremental compilation
* Benchmark support

#### What's next?

Mun is still in early development, so there is a lot to do. The Mun Core Team operates according to
a tick-tock release cycle. Development of a tick release (Mun v0.2) focuses on implementing new
features, whereas a tock release (Mun v0.3) focuses on using and improving existing features.

In particular, we'll focus on making a Rust+Mun game demo that showcases Mun's hot reloading
capabilities and we'll be working on a `cargo`-like application for better Mun project management.
For a complete roadmap, please visit our
[GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/mun-lang/mun/milestones).

As Mun consists of a separate language, runtime, and an ABI that forms the communication protocol
between the two; any language can benefit from the Mun Runtime's hot reloading capabilities. This
leaves room for others to integrate the Mun ABI with (a semantic subset) of other languages such
as Rust.

#### How can I learn more?

To get started, read the [Mun Book](https://docs.mun-lang.org/v0.2) and have a look at our
[Rust](https://github.com/mun-lang/mun/tree/master/crates/mun_runtime/examples) and
[C++](https://github.com/mun-lang/example-cpp) examples.
